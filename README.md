**Abstract:**

*Mesothelioma is a highly lethal and poorly biologically understood disease which presents diagnostic challenges due to its morphological complexity. This study uses self-supervised AI (Artificial Intelligence) to map the histomorphological landscape of the disease. The resulting atlas consists of recurrent patterns identified from 3446 Hematoxylin and Eosin (H\&E) stained images scanned from resected tumour slides. These patterns generate highly interpretable predictions, achieving state-of-the-art performance with 0.65 concordance index (c-index) for outcomes and 85% AUC in subtyping. Their clinical relevance is endorsed by comprehensive human pathological assessment. Furthermore, we characterise the molecular underpinnings of these diverse, meaningful, predictive patterns. Our approach both improves diagnosis and deepens our understanding of mesothelioma biology, highlighting the power of this self-learning method in clinical applications and scientific discovery.*
## Workspace setup 
*You can find the full details on HPL instructions in this [Readme_HPL file](README_HPL.md). The code is based on the [HPL paper GitHub](https://github.com/AdalbertoCq/Histomorphological-Phenotype-Learning.git), and minor changes were made to be compatible with our mesothelioma dataset.*
